\section{Overview}

This document provides specifications for a \textit{firefly simulator}. This
device is intended to simulate the light displays of common fireflies, such
as \textit{Photinus pyralis}. The \textit{firefly simulator} will provide means
to control the brightness, duration, and other relevant parameters of the
simulated light display. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) will be used as the light
source, and the color of the display can be altered by connecting different
LED types to the simulator.

The \textit{firefly simulator} can be configured via commands issued to it
from a host computer, as shown in Fig.\ \ref{fig:BlockDiagram}. The physical
link between the host computer and the \textit{firefly simulator} is an
asynchronous serial communications interface, which can be accomplished with a
common and inexpensive USB adapter. The \textit{firefly simulator} also can
return status information to the host computer via the same interface.

Once configured, the \textit{firefly simulator} can be used in a stand-alone
mode, without requiring a connection to a host computer. Pushbuttons on the
\textit{firefly simulator} can be used to activate light displays that were
previously configured. When in the stand-alone mode, the simulator can be
powered by a USB powerbank.

This document describes the minimum required functionality of the
\textit{firefly simulator}. Possible future enhancements to the simulator
include:
\begin{compactitem}
  \item The ability to sense the behavior of a test specimen and use that
    behavior to modify the parameters of a light display.
  \item The ability to record information about simulator activity on
    non-volatile memory, such as a removable Secure Digital (SD) memory card.
  \item The addition of a real-time clock (RTC) to the \textit{firefly
    simulator} so that timestamps can be added to response messages from the 
    simulator to the host computer.
\end{compactitem}

\begin{supertabular}{p{1.25in}p{5.25in}}
abort &
    A pushbutton input to the \textit{firefly simulator}. Pressing this button
    causes the simulator to stop any repeated \textit{flashes} or
    \textit{patterns}, and to bring the \textit{illumination level} to 0\% on
    all \textit{channels}.\\
ASCII &
    The American Standard Code for Information Interchange. The letters in
    the English alphabet, the decimal digits, and common punctuation marks are
    assigned a unique 7-bit binary code.\\
channel &
    The \textit{channel} of an \textit{LED} is an integer that specifies
    which physical output connector of the firefly simulator is connected
    to the physical LED. The value of \textit{channel} is an integer and
    shall not be less than 1 and not greater than \textit{max channel}.\\
        &
    Note that the \textit{channel} is not the pin number of any particular
    microcontroller. An implementation of the firefly simulator must perform
    the appropriate mapping of an \textit{LED}'s \textit{channel} to an
    appropriate physical pin on the output device.\\
%delay step&
%    A time interval in a \textit{pattern} when all \textit{LEDs} are dark.
%    A \textit{delay step} is a step in a \textit{pattern} that inserts a time
%    delay but does not cause a flash.\\
down duration & 
    The length of the \textit{ramp down} interval. The \textit{down duration}
    is equal to $t_4 - t_3$, as shown in Fig.\ \ref{fig:FlashPulse}. The
    \textit{down duration} shall be a non-negative integer value with units
    of milliseconds. The value of \textit{down duration} shall not be less
    than 0 or greater than 32\,767.\\
%duty factor &  For a periodic rectangular pulse that has only two possible
%    voltage levels, the \textit{duty factor} is the ratio of the duration of
%    the pulse at its higher voltage divided by the period of the waveform.
%
%    \[ 0.0 \le d_f \le 1.0 \quad \mathrm{ or } \quad 0\% \le d_f \le 100\%\]
event &
    An external event that can be recognized by the \textit{firefly simulator}.
    Details TBD.\\
flash &
    The process of bringing the \textit{illumination level} of an \textit{LED}
    from 0\% to 100\% then back to 0\% illumination. A \textit{flash} consists of
    a \textit{ramp up}, followed by an \textit{on time}, followed by a
    \textit{ramp down}. A \textit{flash} begins at $t_1$ and ends at $t_4$,
    as shown in Fig.\ \ref{fig:FlashPulse}. The interval from $t_1$ to $t_2$
    is the \textit{ramp up}. The interval from $t_2$ to $t_3$ is the \textit{on
    time}.  The interval from $t_3$ to $t_4$ is the \textit{ramp down}. The
    interval from $t_4$ to $t_5$ is the \textit{interpulse interval}.\\
    &
    Note the definition of a \textit{flash} primarily specifies the
    \textit{timing} behavior of the \textit{flash}. The selection of a specific
    physical LED and its \textit{max brightness} are part of the definition
    of an \textit{LED}.\\
flash pattern interval &
    The total time duration of a \textit{pattern}.
    This interval includes the time of all \textit{flashes} in the pattern
    as well as the subsequent time when there are no flashes, as shown in
    Fig.\ \ref{fig:PatternTimeline}. The
    \textit{flash pattern interval} is a parameter of a \textit{pattern}.\\
illumination level &
    The brightness of an \textit{LED} at any given point in time, as a
    percentage of that \textit{LED}'s \textit{max brightness}. The
    \textit{illumination level} and \textit{max brightness} values
    indirectly translate to the average current passing through the physical
    LED.\\
    &
    At any given point in time, the average current for an LED is
\[ I_{AVG} = \frac{illumination\,level}{100} \times \frac{max\,brightness}{100}
\times I_{max}\]\\
interpulse interval &
    The total time duration of a \textit{flash}. This interval includes the
    time when the \textit{LED} is illuminated as well as the subsequent time
    when the \textit{LED} is not illuminated, from $t_1$ to $t_5$ in
    Fig.\ \ref{fig:FlashPulse}. The \textit{interpulse interval} is a parameter
    of a \textit{flash}.\\
message &  A sequence of \textit{message fields}, separated by the
    ASCII comma character (decimal 44) and terminated by either the ASCII Line
    Feed (decimal 10), the ASCII Carriage Return (decimal 13), or both the Line
    Feed and the Carriage Return. There shall not be a comma before the first
    field in a message nor after the last field.\\
message field &  A sequence of one or more ASCII characters from the set of
    letters (\texttt{A} through \texttt{Z} and \texttt{a} through \texttt{z}),
    decimal digits (\texttt{0} through \texttt{9}), and the punctuation
    characters required for a \textit{timestamp} (colon, minus, plus, period).
    A message field shall not include a comma.\\
max brightness & 
    The maximum duty factor of the \textit{pulse-width modulation} signal that
    controls the \textit{illumination level} of an \textit{LED}. The
    \textit{max brightness} is a characteristic of an \textit{LED}. The
    value of \textit{max brightness} is an integer and shall be not less
    than 1 and not greater than 100.\\
max channel & 
    The number of physical \textit{LED} \textit{channels} available on a
    particular implementation of a \textit{firefly simulator}.
    The value of \textit{max channel} shall not be less than 1 or greater
    than 127 for any implementation of a \textit{firefly simulator}.\\
max event &
    The number of unique \textit{event} configurations available on a
    particular implementation of a \textit{firefly simulator}.
    The value of \textit{max event} shall not be less than 0 or greater
    than 127 for any implementation of a \textit{firefly simulator}.\\
max flash & 
    The number of unique \textit{flash} configurations available on a
    particular implementation of a \textit{firefly simulator}.
    The value of \textit{max flash} shall not be less than 1 or greater
    than 127 for any implementation of a \textit{firefly simulator}.\\
max LED & 
    The number of unique \textit{LED} configurations available on a
    particular implementation of a \textit{firefly simulator}.
    The value of \textit{max LED} shall not be less than 1 or greater
    than 127 for any implementation of a \textit{firefly simulator}.\\
max pattern & 
    The number of unique \textit{pattern} configurations available on a
    particular implementation of a \textit{firefly simulator}.
    The value of \textit{max pattern} shall not be less than 1 or greater
    than 127 for any implementation of a \textit{firefly simulator}.\\
on duration &
    The length of the \textit{on time} interval. The \textit{on duration} is
    equal to $t_3 - t_2$, as shown in Fig.\ \ref{fig:FlashPulse}. The value
    of \textit{on duration} shall be a positive, non-zero integer with units
    of milliseconds. The value of \textit{on duration} shall not be less than 1
    or greater than 32\,767.\\
on time &
    The period of time during a \textit{flash} when the \textit{LED} is
    constantly at an illumination level of 100\%.\\
pattern &
    A sequence of up to 16 \textit{flashes}, possibly followed by a period
    of time where there are no \textit{flashes}.
    Note that the definition of a \textit{pattern} specifies only the sequence
    of \textit{flashes} that should occur as well as the total duration of the
    \textit{pattern}.\\
%pulse-width modulation & 
ramp down &
    The process of linearly decreasing the \textit{illumination level} of an
    \textit{LED} from 100\% to 0\%.\\
ramp up &
    The process of linearly increasing the \textit{illumination level} of an
    \textit{LED} from 0\% to 100\%.\\
time stamp &
    A representation of the current date and time used as \textit{message field}.
    The \textit{time stamp} shall conform to ISO 8601. The format of the
    \textit{time stamp} is TBD.\\
up duration &
    The length of the \textit{ramp up} interval. The \textit{up duration}
    is equal to $t_2 - t_1$, as shown in Fig.\ \ref{fig:FlashPulse}. The
    value of \textit{up duration} shall be a non-negative integer with units
    of milliseconds. The value of \textit{up duration} shall not be less than

\section{Resolution and Accuracy}

\subsection{Brightness}

The \textit{firefly simulator} does not directly control the brightness of a
physical LED. Instead, the simulator controls the average current provided to
the LED. The simulator's configuration messages allow the actual average
current ($I_{AVG}$) of an LED to be specified with a resolution of $\pm 1$\% of
the maximum available current ($I_{MAX}$). The maximum available current, and
the precision which with the current can be specified, will be
determined by the circuitry associated with a given physical LED and need not be
the same for all LEDs.

\subsection{Time}

Values that represent time shall have units of milliseconds and a resolution
of \SI{1}{\milli\second}. The accuracy of all pulse durations and time delays
generated by the \textit{firefly simulator} over an \textit{interpulse interval}
shall have a maximum error of \SI{\pm 10}{\milli\second}. The cumulative timing
error over a \textit{flash pattern interval} shall not exceed
\SI{200}{\milli\second}.

\section{Configuration Messages}

The firefly simulator is configured via a serial communications interface to
a host computer. The host computer can set the values of all parameters for
\textit{LEDs}, \textit{flashes}, and \textit{patterns}. A unique configuration
message format is specified for configuring an \textit{LED}, configuring a
\textit{flash}, or configuring a \textit{pattern}.

\subsection{\textit{capacity query/capacity response messages}}

The \textit{capacity query message} can be used by the host computer to
determine the capabilities of a \textit{firefly simulator}.

\begin{table}[H]
  \caption{Definition of the \textit{capacity query message}}

    \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \label{tab:CapacityQuery}
\end{table}

The \textit{firefly simulator} will respond to the \textit{capacity query
message} by sending a \textit{capacity response message} to the host computer.

    & This field shall contain a decimal integer from 1 to 127.
    \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \label{tab:CapacityResponse}
\end{table}

\subsection{\textit{LED configuration message}}

An \textit{LED configuration message} is sent from the host computer to the
firefly simulator. Every \textit{LED configuration message} shall contain
four \textit{message fields}, as shown in Table \ref{tab:LEDConfig}.

As an example, the three messages below could be sent by the host computer in
order to configure three \textit{LEDs}.
This example assumes that \textit{LED} 2 uses physical \textit{channel}
1 and has a \textit{max brightness} of 100\%. \textit{LEDs} 3 and 5 use the
same physical \textit{channel} (i.e.\ the same physical LED) but with different
levels of \textit{max brightness}: 87\% and 53\%, respectively.
The \textit{LED} numbers, \textit{channel} numbers, and \textit{max brightness}
levels shown here were chosen
arbitrarily; the purpose of this example is only to illustrate the syntax of
the \textit{LED configuration message}.\\[12pt]

  \end{tabular}
  \label{tab:LEDConfig}
\end{table}

\subsection{\textit{flash configuration message}}

An \textit{flash configuration message} is sent from the host computer to the
firefly simulator. This message provides the parameters for a single
\textit{flash} of an \textit{LED}, as shown in Table \ref{tab:FlashConfig}.

As an example, the three messages below could be sent by the host computer in
order to configure the three \textit{flashes} shown in Fig.\
\ref{fig:PatternTimeline}. This example assumes that \textit{flash} 1 uses
\textit{LED} 2, \textit{flash} 4 uses \textit{LED} 3, and \textit{flash} 7 uses
\textit{LED} 5. The \textit{flash} and \textit{LED} numbers were chosen
arbitrarily; the purpose of this example is only to illustrate the syntax of
the \textit{flash configuration message}.\\[12pt]

             \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{\textit{pattern configuration message}}

An \textit{pattern configuration message} is sent from the host computer to the
firefly simulator. This message provides the parameters for a single
\textit{pattern} of one or more \textit{flashes}, as shown in Table
\ref{tab:PatternConfig}. Note that the same \textit{flash} may be repeated
within a pattern.

A \textit{pattern} may contain from 1 to 16 flashes. Therefore, field 4 in the
\textit{pattern configuration message} may be repeated to define
the desired \textit{flashes} in the pattern. If the \textit{pattern
configuration message} specifies fewer than 16 \textit{flashes} then the
unspecified \textit{flashes} shall have a default \textit{flash} number of 0
(zero) and will be ignored during execution of the \textit{pattern}.

As an example, the message below could be sent by the host computer in
order to configure the \textit{pattern} shown in Fig.\
\ref{fig:PatternTimeline}. This particular pattern was arbitrarily designated
as pattern 5. It contains four \textit{flashes}, but one of the previously
defined \textit{flashes} was repeated. The total duration of this pattern
(i.e.\ the \textit{flash pattern interval}) is \SI{10}{\second}.\\[12pt]

\section{Command and Response Messages}

The host computer can command the \textit{firefly simulator} to turn on an
\textit{LED} at a specified \textit{illumination level}, repeatedly execute a
specific \textit{flash}, repeatedly execute a specific \textit{pattern}, or
repeatedly execute a set of available \textit{patterns} in a pseudorandom order.

Once the \textit{firefly simulator} has received and started executing a
command message it will not respond to any messages sent by the host computer.
Every command must be terminated by pressing the \textit{abort} button before
the \textit{firefly simulator} will respond to messages from the host computer.

\subsection{\textit{Execute LED message}}

An \textit{Execute LED message} is sent from the host computer to the
firefly simulator. This message can be used to turn an LED on for
testing or calibration purposes. Every \textit{Execute LED message} shall
contain three \textit{message fields}, as shown in Table \ref{tab:ExecuteLED}.

\begin{table}[H]
  \caption{Definition of the \textit{Execute LED message}}
  \centering
  \setlength\extrarowheight{2pt}
  \begin{tabular}[h]{|p{0.5in}|p{1.00in}|p{2.25in}|p{2.25in}|} \hline
    Field Number & Field Name & Description & Format \\ \hline
    1            & Header
                 & Unique first two characters for an \textit{Execute LED
                 message}
                 & This field shall be the uppercase letters `\texttt{XL}'.
                 \\ \hline
    2            & LED \textit{channel}
                 & A unique identifier for a physical LED
                 & This field shall contain a decimal integer from 1 to
                 \textit{max channel}.
                 \\ \hline
    3            & \textit{illumination level}
                 & Sets a constant value for the \textit{illumination level}
                 of the \textit{LED}
                 & This field shall contain a decimal integer from 0 to 100.
                 A value of 100 causes the \textit{illumination level} of the
                 LED to be set at a constant value of 100\% (of the
                 \textit{LED}'s \textit{max brightness} level). A `0' shall
                 cause the \textit{illumination level} of the LED to be set at
                 0\% (completely dark).
                 \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \label{tab:ExecuteLED}
\end{table}

\subsection{\textit{Execute flash message}}
